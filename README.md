# eyeDropper

A simple eye dropper developed for a college assignment with the aim of creating a solution using at least 2 [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

## Web APIs used

1 - [EyeDropper API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper_API) - Used to create a an eyedropper tool. Using this tool, users can sample colors from their screens, including outside of the browser window.

2 - [Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API) - Used to store a most recent and previous color choice.
